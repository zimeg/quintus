Here within are **handlers** that receive incoming requests for timings that
match a calendar.

```sh
$ make start      # Start the server
$ sntp localhost  # Ask for the time
```

## Serving time with a time server

The [Network Time Protocol][ntp] (NTP) has a specification for how timed
responses should be sent - [RFC5905][rfc]. This is implemented to respond to
incoming requests for the time using a UDP connection on port `123`.
